# node-rest-api
This is an example for a node-rest-api project

## Nodemon
Gives to the server the ability to stay listing all the changes that we make, like the hot-reload in React.js

## Express
Interface to create routes 

## DotEnv
All your data needs to be hidden, here is when dotenv enters, and make it possible.

## Body-parser
When a post hits the service, the "req" data is undefined, at less that we already have a main middleware with body-parser inside, this way, we can read and understand the "req" data.

## Mongoose
We need connect with our database, so mongoose give us the way to do that, and other cool things, for example, modeling the data, etc.
